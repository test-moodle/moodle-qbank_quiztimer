# Question Bank - Quiztimer #

## Introduction
This Moodle plugin adds a time column to the question bank, allowing you to assign a specific time limit to each question directly within the question bank, which can then be applied in any quiz. It is designed to work alongside the [moodle-quizaccess_quiztimer](https://github.com/UNIMOODLE/moodle-quizaccess_quiztimer) plugin, enabling you to set individual time limits for each question, section, and page rather than a single time limit for the entire quiz.
